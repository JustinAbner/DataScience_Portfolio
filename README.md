# Data Science Portfolio
Here are some of my favorite projects showcasing my skills across different domains utilizing various programming languages, packages, and technologies!
## About
### Education
- M.S., Data Science - Bellevue University (June 2024) (GPA: 4.0)
- B.S. - Frostburg State University (May 2020)


### Technical Skills
Python, SQL, R, Nifi, PySpark, Kafka, Hadoop


## Projects
### [Weather Service Utilizing an API](https://github.com/JustinAbner/Weather_Service)
This project revolves around a weather API and user input. Users are prompted to choose if they wish to enter either a zipcode or city/state of the area they wish, and the respective coordinates are retrieved. An API request with the coordinates and an API key are used to obtain the temperature (the current, high, and low of the day), the pressure, humidity, cloud cover status, and the overall weather description.

### [Utilizing Big Data Tools to Predict Ukraine War Outcomes](https://github.com/JustinAbner/UkraineWar_and_BigDataTools)
This Project utilizes big data tools such as NiFi, HDFS, and PySpark to ingest, query, store, and perform machine learning to predict the outcome type to determine if civilians should flee or if they will be relatively safe to stay. A flow was created in NiFi to ingest the data, query it to select the desired columns/data range, and then return the modified data. HDFS received the data where its storage capabilities were utilized thus being accessible to PySpark. PySpark was used to further clean the data and prepare it for machine learning in which a Decision Tree Classifier was used and a metric evaluated.

### [Transaction Fraud Detection (Logistic Regression vs Random Forest Classifier)](https://github.com/JustinAbner/Transaction_Fraud_ML)
This project utilizes synthetic transaction data to predict fraud. Models and tools such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Pipelines, and GridSearchCV were utilized to maximize the model metrics.
