# Predicting Arsenic Arsenic Concentrations in CWS (Currently in Progress)

## Utilizing data such as population size, counts of certain diseases, and environmental indexes for specific counties, we will predict arsenic (parts per billion) concentrations in community water systems. This project looks at how Linear, Bayesian Ridge, and Decision Tree Regression models stack up to one another.
