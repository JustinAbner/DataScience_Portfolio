# Predicting Arsenic Arsenic Concentrations in CWS (Currently in Progress)

## We will be utilizing data such as population size, counts of certain diseases, and environmental indexes for specific counties to predict arsenic concentrations in community water systems (CWS). A Pipeline will be created, which will contain a Linear Regression and a Standard Scaler.
